I took the chance on the branch dev4 to integrate the frontend developed on the tutorial "https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-security-and-angular-js/".

This fe is a very basic angular application which do login following the protocol of CSRF, and as it was implemented here.

The difference from the tutorial is that there it was used spring-boot which hides a lot of configutarion that I've set here mannually, also I've done the things here using xml nampespacing and not java configuration as done on the tutorial. It is just another way to do the same thing =]

Nothing has been defined yet for CORS.
